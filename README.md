# Face-mask-classification-with-tensorflow

This project aims to detect whether or not a person is wearing a face mask.The image input which you give to the system will be analyzed
and the predicted result will be given as output.

## Conceptual Framework:
The project is entirely implemented using Python3.

The Conceptual Framework involved is mainly:
Keras â€“ Tensorflow backend

## Model
I have built a model consisting of 5 convolutions and 5 max pooling layers, with ReLU as the activation function.

```python
model.summary()
```

## Accuracy
I achieved the training accuracy of 96.47%.
